          <h2> End of the hearing aid era! <br> The Revolutionary Therapy of a Filipino Professor <span> naturally
              restores hearing within 28 days </span></h2>
          <img src="images/one.jpg" alt="" class="alignCenter fullWidth pic_one">
          <h3> Does the new hearing recovery method hurt the hearing aid market? Big names in laryngology have no doubt
            that this will happen. Together with the development of a natural macromolecular formula by a Filipino, the
            long-awaited reversal in the struggle for <a href="http://hearing-ph.link/ph/">better hearing</a> has finally arrived. <br> Already
            over 14,000 people who have
            applied this therapy recover their damaged hearing cells within 28 days. As a result, they have regained
            their hearing, even those who were threatened with complete deafness. How is that possible? </h3>
          <br>
          <p> Prof. John Mendoza (Molecular Biology Expert) decided to help his mother with her hearing, which was
            getting weaker and weaker. That's what started a this laryngology revolution. The professor, after 11 months
            of laboratory research, worked out <strong> a natural, safe and easy to use </strong> formula that enhances
            hearing. </p>
          <p> Professional medical journals have already described this therapy as a "pioneering achievement in the
            field of laryngology" and the professor has received a <strong> nomination for the Nobel Prize. </strong>
            Thanks to the action of his formula, even people with advanced hearing problems are able <strong> to restore
              hearing cells, to regain their natural hearing ability </strong> and eliminate the need to carry a hearing
            aid. </p>
          <h4> "The hearing aids are money thrown to the wind!" What are the reasons for this opinion? </h4>
          <img src="images/img2.jpg" alt="" style="" class="img2">
          <p> This is confirmed by over 14,000 satisfied users of the macro-molecular <a href="http://hearing-ph.link/ph/">hearing recovery
              formula</a>, people who
            <strong> no longer carry hearing aids </strong> . So we decided to pay attention to these devices. More
            precisely, we decided to check what their shortcomings are and what do the people using them have to deal
            with. Here are the conclusions: </p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4> Hearing aids are expensive </h4>
              <p> The value of one apparatus is 1 to 6 thousand leva and this is not a one-off expense. Batteries are
                also needed, and the annual battery expenses are over 200 leva! Even if someone is able to afford such a
                charge, he will not avoid the other drawbacks of this device. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4> It creates shame and discomfort </h4>
              <p> People who wear a hearing aid suffer for this reason because they are perceived as disabled. It takes
                an emotional toll on them when they have to answer questions like "What is this thing that sticks out of
                the ear?". </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4> They emit secondary sounds </h4>
              <p> People using a hearing aid complain of the terrible quality of the perceived sounds. Hearing aids
                generate irritating buzzing that leads to irritation and stress. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4> It causes infections that deepen hearing problems </h4>
              <p> Hearing devices can cause fungus, which can lead to dangerous ear infections. These infections further
                reduce hearing. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4> They enhance sounds only during use </h4>
              <p> The appliance should be removed during contact with water, for example before bathing. It is also
                taken off during sleep. They can not lead to permanent hearing recovery. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5 style="margin-top: 40px;"> That is why Professor Mendoza's macro-molecular therapy represents a real
            breakthrough in the fight for <a href="http://hearing-ph.link/ph/">better
              hearing</a> </h5>
          <p> Hearing aids artificially amplify sounds only during wear. Instead, Prof. Mendoza 's therapy restores
            hearing cells by <a href="http://hearing-ph.link/ph/">regaining their natural
              ability to hear</a>, without having to carry a hearing aid. The ingredients it contains have strong
            restorative properties. These ingredients supply the ear with everything they require to restore the hearing
            even of people with serious hearing loss. </p>
          <h5> Everyone is now able to regain 100% hearing ability </h5>
          <p> The therapy is marketed under the name Aurifix. The formula is capsules, which must be taken with more
            water.. You just have to drink it every morning. Applying the therapy is completely safe, as evidenced by
            further research by the German research center in Stuttgart. These studies also show that the therapy has
            over 98% efficacy. Thanks to this, people between the ages of 38 and 93, in just 28 days, have achieved
            incredible results in dealing with hearing problems. They manage all this regardless of the age, cause, and
            duration of hearing problems. </p>
          <p> For these people, immediately after drinking it, the auditory canal was "unclogged". Thanks to this,
            hearing was increased by 50% and they began to perceive the full range of sounds coming from a farther
            distance. In thefollowing days of therapy, their hearing focused better on human speech, <strong> thanks to
              which they began to clearly hear conversations at an even greater distance. </strong> Then they got rid of
            the pain and the tingling in the ears caused by the contamination of the auditory canal. </p>
          <p> As a result, they reduced the congestion of hearing centers in the brain by as much as 80% and increased
            their energy level three times. This is not all - after 28 days of therapy, the participants in the therapy
            unanimously admitted that their hearing was now more acute. <strong> Now they hear exactly as di when they
              were between 25! </strong></p>
          <h5> The documented effects of therapy speak for themselves: </h5>

          <h5> Ed Apostol 51 years old from Cebu City is the first person to use Aurifix: </h5>
          <img src="images/two.jpg" alt="" class="alignCenter fullWidth">
          <p> "With me hearing problems started long ago, when I was 40. I thought it was normal - I'm getting old, so I
            hear less well. A few years later, however, I couldn't understand what they were saying to me. I was ashamed
            to constantly ask people: "What? Please? ". I even used a hearing aid. I gave a pile of money for this thing
            - two whole pensions I spent, but it only hindered me! I did not want have surgery. I couldn't let them open
            up my head! In time I found out about Aurifix. Now I know that if I had not applied this therapy, I would
            probably have made the biggest mistake in my life. I was deaf like a log, and I only needed 4 weeks and <a
              href="http://hearing-ph.link/ph/">now I hear even whispers, no hearing aid</a>!
            No problem watching TV, listening to my radio and talking on the phone. I finally hear people on the street,
            in the store or on the bus. It's so nice to hear the sound of the trees and the singing of the birds in the
            park again. Thank you very much." </p>
          <h5> Why give a pile of money for an ineffective hearing aid, provided it is possible to recover hearing in a
            natural and inexpensive way? </h5>
          <p> The efficacy of Aurifix has been confirmed by the German research center in Stuttgart. Prof. Mendoza is
            constantly collecting nominations for awards for his scientific discovery, including <strong> nomination for
              the Nobel Prize. </strong></p>
          <p> The good news is that <strong> Aurifix can be taken at the discount club, for less money. </strong> You
            will receive the therapy <a href="http://hearing-ph.link/ph/">only through the

            <p> Ladies and gentlemen, let me say I've suffered with hearing aids for over 6 years. For many years I've
              been working at the docks and it's what probably what damaged my hearing.
              I've spent 10000 pesos just for hearing aids. For others it might not be a lot but I'm a dock worker. They
              bothered me all the time, putting them on, taking them off, keeping them away from my grandkids, and when
              I had it on I even scared them. But my daughter gave me this product, and the aids went in the trash – I
              have my hearing back! I don't know if it works for everyone, but you have to try it </p>

              I'm sick of this hearing aid. I constantly conceal it with my hair, and that is how you can see these
              constant noises and writing, you can just go mad. will finally get rid of it, WONDERFUL </p>

            <p> I work as a clerk and constantly communicate with people. I constantly ask them to repeat their words,
              it was so humiliating. They finally wanted to fire me, so I took this terrible device called a hearing
              aid, with a cable coming out of the ear. However, I also have to look good. I'm not that old yet, and I'm
              a lady. Several times now I've set my sights on someone, so to say, but I was ashamed of the aid. And now
              I will finally change my life, thank you very much !!! :) </p>

              it's too loud. Please help me decide

              <a href="http://hearing-ph.link/ph/">fixed his hearing after only 3 weeks</a>
              and I'm not afraid for him anymore. I recommend it </p>

            <p> I am still young (36 years old) and I still don't have hearing trouble, but I work with loud sounds so I
              use Aurifix prophylactically to prevent loss. So if someone else like me works with among noise, I
              recommend it </p>
